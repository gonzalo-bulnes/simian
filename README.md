Caution—This code is proof-of-concept quality. This means:

  * The API is unstable and doesn’t support common use cases.
  * The index format is unstable.
  * It is not thread safe.
  * Test coverage is mostly non-existant.
  * The current fingerprinting method has known weaknesses which affect quality of results.
